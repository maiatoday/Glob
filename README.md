# Glob

processing sketch with physics and jelly - take the example and modify it

## some ideas

* nudge the jelly around 
* avoid the sponge objects
* you can see which one is the main glob because it has a sparkly centre
* yellow and red globs make you bigger
* blue and green globs make you smaller a bit
* sponges stay fixed
* globs drop down
* if you touch a sponge you shrink alot and maybe your movement is affected for a while

The aim of the game is to clear the screen before you disappear.

## TODO
* scan sponge images
* make sandpaper sounds
* scan jelly images
* make gloopy glob sounds
* make a background image
* make data structures
* figure out logic :)

## Bonus tasks:
* make the main Glob colour change as it melds with the other globs it meets
* make the globs shudder and wobble
